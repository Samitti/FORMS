# Bare Metal Forms and Helpers
  In this project, we build forms the old fashioned way and then the Rails way. We created a form using almost pure HTML and then gradually changed the structure using the helper methods Ruby on Rails provides.

# Built With
- RUBY
- RoR 

# Prerequisites
- Get Ruby and Ruby on Rails (RoR) latest version installed

# Install
- Install VSCode or any code editor you like
- Install Node JS and nmp(most recents versions)

# Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

- Open a terminal or command prompt interface on your machine
- Clone the project unto your local machine: `git clone https://github.com/Samitti/FORMS.git`
- From your terminal enter the project directory using `cd FORMS` 

# Instructions

- Run ` rake db:migrate ` to have the database tables created and setup on your locoal machine.
- Run ` rails server ` or ` rails s ` on your terminal to start the integrated ruby server.
- Open your web browser and go to ` localhost:3000 `, to see that the rails sever is up and running.
- If the index page of the application doesn't open automatically go to ` localhost:3000/users/new ` to  create a new user.
- You will need to create new users to test-out the database, do so using the form on the webpage.
